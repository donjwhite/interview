# Neovest coding interview problems

This project contains Java and C++ skeleton solutions for the two problems described below. 

Candidates are asked to implement a solution to one of the problems and add additional unit tests.

## Contents

* src/main - Java stubs for the solution, each in a separate package
* src/test/java - junit unit tests
* src/test/groovy - Spock unit tests
* cpp (cpp branch only) - C++ project skeleton

## Problems

### Least common multiple

Given two numbers, find the least common multiple that both numbers share

Example:

lcm(5, 7) -> 35

  5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
  7, 14, 21, 28, 35

lcm(2, 4) -> 4

  2, 4
  4

lcm(4, 6) -> 12

  4, 8, 12
  6, 12

### Average price per share
